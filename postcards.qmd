Voter turnout in elections is often influenced by several factors, one of which is social pressure. Using the dataset of registered voters from a 2006 field experiment in Michigan, I seek to estimate the causal effect of receiving a postcard on the probability that a registered voter participates in the 2006 Michigan primary election. However, the data might include more politically active people which can lead to biased inference.

$$
P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_n X_n)}}
$$

where $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\rho)$ and $\rho = P(Y=1)$.
